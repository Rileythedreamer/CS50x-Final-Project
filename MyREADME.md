#### title :               E-commerce Website
- One sentence summary : An Online Shop for selling & buying Clothes
- Who is the target user? Everone , mainly people who are busy and therefor are more comfortable shopping online. 
mainly owner's who have an Instagram page for selling clothes but would like to expand their customer audience.
- Main goal

What problem does it solve for these users? people who use instagram for online shopping know that it's not suitable for that task the user experience isn't 
optimized for that, Instagram Shops also lack reliability becuase there isn't much of a certificate or anything like that which would provide illegibility.
INSTAGRAM is also unreliable as a website because the servers are foreign which means it might be 
hard to access sometimes or you might need a VPN for it but if you have a website as an online shop people can access your webiste even with a poor inetner Connection,.
