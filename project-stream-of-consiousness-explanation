TODO :I need to add an owner's dashboard which has links to create product page and view all the orders everyone has ever placed.
I decided to build an e commerce website for my final project because there are lots of shops in my country who sell their products using Instagram which isn't designed to be an e commerce platform
 so i thought many shop owners might start wanting to have their own websites which is more reliable as an e commerce platform.
To start I needed a general idea of what functionalities my website needed to have, 
(my goal was to build a website for selling clothes)In order to define my own requirments I started by visiting several online Clothing Stores like Nike, Adidas, ZARA and several others
later in the development process  I also used these websites for mock data.  
After writting down a todolist for all the functionalities i needed to implement  
 I listed all the front end pages i needed for the shop
 (the necessary ones first and I would add more if i realized i needed them along the way)
 and i minimized writting custom css styles to speed up the process,
 I generally prefer minimal designs so I mainly just used Bootstrap to keep everything looking tidy.
After listing the all the html files i would need I started  writting the front end code for them and in the beginning i hardcoded all the data i would convert these data to jinja syntax once i had moved on
to the backend
- home.html : the main landing page of the shop
- shop.html : which would list all the products avilable in the shop 
- contact.html : which would inslude the contact detail of the shop like phone number and address
-
- 
At the beginning when i started coding it up I realized shop owners would probably want to be able to manage their database of products using the website they would want to delete items when they
 get unavailable and add new products So i realized i needed to add role based authentication so that the owners would have access to an Owner's Dashboard which would allow them to manage their shop.
this dashboard is how i added products to the database myself.
